# hello-world
Testing the repository function :) 

My name is Brighton,
This is almost a haiku
I play bluegrass music

I can't wait to write some code on Git with Python! 

Last night I discovered a a really cool hidden Speakeasy!
I also made Mango Lychee Martinis! Thye were not the best! 
I used a dash of Midori to coat the glass, but likely went overboard on the Gin lmao
I call it the Whale's Tale inspired by Erinport's legendary dive.

Okay, time for code!!
