# hello-world
Testing the repository function :) 

Ahoy! 

My name is Brighton,
This is almost a haiku,
I play mandolin!

Is there a program that counts syllables? that could be super cool.
I can't wait to write some code on Git with Python! 


Last night I discovered a hidden Speakeasy!
I also made Mango Lychee Martinis! Thye were not the best! 
I used a dash of Midori to coat the glass, but likely went overboard on the Gin...
I call it the Whale's Tale inspired by Erinport's legendary dive.

Okay, time for code!!
